#   in this file:
#
#   Keyword		
#   -------------    
#
#   LogFilename		
# 	The name of the most recent log file. Less recent log files have the 
# 	number 1 to (n - 1) appended to their names; the larger the number,
# 	the less recent the file.
#
#   logFileSize 	
#	The Size of log files in K bytes. Maximum size of a log file. 
#	When the size of the most recent log file reaches this value,
#	it is renamed and a new log file is created.
#
#   numLogFiles		
#	The number of log files desired. The maximum value for 
#	"numLogFiles" is 4. A new file is created when the size of
#	the log file  is equal or more than the size specified by
#	the keyword "logFileSize".
#	When the number of log files reaches the "numLogFiles" 
#	the log files start rotating.
#
#   tracelevel		
#	The tracing/debug level to do.
# 	8 = DPI level 1
#       16 = DPI level 2
#       32 = Internal level 1
#      	64 = Internal level 2
#      128 = Internal level 3
#      Add the numbers for multiple trace levels
