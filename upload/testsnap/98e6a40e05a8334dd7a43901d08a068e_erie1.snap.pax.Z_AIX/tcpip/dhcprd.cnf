#   A line starting with a '#' character is a comment and is ignored.
#   A '#' on a line which is not part of a quoted string indicates
#   that anything to the right of this character is a comment and should
#   be ignored.
#
#   The directives are specified in the form of 
#   <keyword> <value1> ... <valueN>.
#
#   Here is a list of all the keywords whose value can be specified  
#   in this file:
#
#   Keyword	     Effect
#   -------------    ---------------------------------------------------
#
#   numLogFiles	     The number of log files desired.
#   logFileSize	     The Size of log files in K bytes.
#   logFileName	     The name of the most recent log file.
#   logItem	     One item to be logged.
#
#   server           The server to send the packets to.  Multiple are allowed.
#
#   The presence and values of these parameters are picked up by the
#   relay agent that is started or restarted.
#

#
#  Log files.  This set of parameters specifies the log files that will be
#  maintained by this server.  Each parameter is identified by a keyword
#  and followed by its value.
#
#  Keyword	Value	      	Definition
#  --------	------------  	------------------------------------------
#  numLogFiles	0 to n	      	number of log files.  If 0 is specified, 
#				no log file will be maintained and no log 
#				message	is display anywhere.  n is the 
#				maximum number of log files maintained as 
#				the size of the most recent log file 
#				reaches its maximum size and a new log file 
#				is created.
#
#  logFileSize	in K bytes	maximum size of a log file.  When the size 
#				of the most recent log file reaches this 
#				value, it is renamed and a new log file is 
#				created.
#
#  logFileName	file path	name of the most recent log file.  Less 
#				recent log files have the number 1 to 
#				(n - 1) appended to their names; the larger 
#				the number, the less recent the file.
#
#  logItem			One item that will be logged. 
#		SYSERR		System error, at the interface to the platform.
#		OBJERR		Object error, in between objects in the process.
#		PROTERR		Protocol error, between client and server.
#		WARNING		Warning, worth of attention from the user.
#		EVENT		Event occurred to the process.
#		ACTION		Action taken by the process.
#		INFO		Information that might be useful.
#		ACNTING		Who was served when.
#		TRACE		Code flow, for debugging.
