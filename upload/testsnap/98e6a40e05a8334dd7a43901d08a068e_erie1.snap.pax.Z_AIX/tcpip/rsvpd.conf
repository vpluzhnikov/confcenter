#
#	rsvpd.conf
#
#	This file contains configuration statements for the RSVP agent.
#
#	If this file is not present at the /etc directory, RSVP is
#	enabled on all network interfaces with the default parameters.
#
#	This file contains one or more statements.  A statement appears as 
#	a block of lines.  The first line starts with the keyword of the 
#	statement, followed by one or more parameters.  
#
#	The first parameter is usually an IP address.  In its place, the 
#	word "all" or "others" may be used to designate the unspecific.
#
#	The second parameter, if present, is the word "disabled".
#	Its absence is equivalent to the presence of "enabled".
#
#       A trailing "off" at the end of the first line of a statement disables
#	the statement itself.  Its effect is the same as removing the entire 
#	statement from the file or commenting it out.
#
#	Statements may be nested.  In such a case, the second line of the 
#	block is an open curly brace.  The nested statements start on the 
#	third line downward.  The close curly brace occupies an entire line.
#

#
# Interface Statement
#
#   This statement makes available to the RSVP agent one of the network
#   interfaces of the local host.
#
#   If this statement is absent, none of the network interfaces is available
#   to the RSVP agent.
#
#   One or more of these statements may be present.
#
#
# Examples of Interface Statement:
#
#interface 9.23.78.13		# Interface is available.
#{				# Specifics within the interface.
#
#    trafficControl		# Enable traffic control on the interface.
#
#}				
#
#interface 21.64.112.32 disabled # Interface is not available.
#			
#
#

#
# RSVP Statement
#
#   This statement enables RSVP on the local host or on a particular network
#   interface of the local host and specifies its related parameters.
#
#   If this statement is absent, RSVP processing is disabled on all interfaces.
#
#   One or more of these statement may be present.
#
#
# Example of RSVP Statement:
#
#rsvp 9.23.78.13		# Enable RSVP on this interface.
#{				
#
#    maxFlows 64		# Maximum RSVP flows traversing the interface.
#
#
#}				
#
#rsvp others disabled		# This is the default.
#

# End of rsvpd.conf
