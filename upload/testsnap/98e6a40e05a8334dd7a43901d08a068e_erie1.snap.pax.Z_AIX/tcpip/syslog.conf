# /etc/syslog.conf - control output of syslogd
#
#
# Each line must consist of two parts:-
#
# 1) A selector to determine the message priorities to which the 
#    line applies
# 2) An action.
#
# Each line can contain an optional part:-
#
# 3) Rotation.
#
# The fields must be separated by one or more tabs or spaces.
#
# format:
#
# <msg_src_list> <destination> [rotate [size <size> k|m] [files <files>] [time <time> h|d|w|m|y] [compress] [archive <archive>]]
#
# where <msg_src_list> is a semicolon separated list of <facility>.<priority>
# where:
#
# <facility> is:
#	* - all (except mark)
#	mark - time marks
#	kern,user,mail,daemon, auth,... (see syslogd(AIX Commands Reference)) 
#
# <priority> is one of (from high to low):
#	emerg/panic,alert,crit,err(or),warn(ing),notice,info,debug
#	(meaning all messages of this priority or higher)
#
# <destination> is:
#	/filename - log to this file
#	username[,username2...] - write to user(s)
#	@hostname - send to syslogd on this machine
#	* - send to all logged in users
#
# [rotate [size <size> k|m] [files <files>] [time <time> h|d|w|m|y] [compress] [archive <archive>]] is:
#       If <destination> is a regular file and the word "rotate" is
#       specified, then the <destination> is limited by either
#       <size> or <time>, or both <size> and <time>. The <size> causes
#       the <destination> to be limited to <size>, with <files> files
#       kept in the rotation. The <time> causes the <destination> to be rotated after
#       <time>. If both <time> and <size> are specified then logfiles
#       will be rotated once the the logfile size exceeds the <size>
#       or after <time>, whichever is earlier. The rotated filenames
#	are created by appending a period and a number to <destination>,
#	starting with ".0".
#
#       If compress option is specified then the logfile names will be
#       generated with a ".Z" extension. The files keyword will be applicable
#       to the logfiles which are currently under rotation. For example
#       if we specify the compress option then only fileis with ".Z" extension
#       will be under rotation and number of such files will be limited by
#       <files> files. Any logfiles with an extension other than ".Z"
#       will not be under the rotation scheme and thus will not be within
#       the limit of <files> files. Similarly if we remove the compress
#       option then the files which have been generated with ".Z" extension
#       will no longer be the part of rotation scheme and will not be limited
#       by the <files> files.
#
#       The minimum size that can be specified is 10k, the minimum
#       number of files that can be specified is 2. The default
#       size is 1m (meg) and the default for <files> is unlimited.
#       Therefore, if only "rotate" is specified, the log will be
#       rotated with <size> = 1m.
#       The compress option means that rotated log files that are not
#       in use will be compressed.
#       The archive option will save rotated log files that are not
#       in use to <archive>.
#       The default is not to rotate log files.
#
# example:
# "mail messages, at debug or higher, go to Log file. File must exist."
# "all facilities, at debug and higher, go to console"
# "all facilities, at crit or higher, go to all users"
#  mail.debug		/usr/spool/mqueue/syslog
#  *.debug		/dev/console
#  *.crit			*
#  *.debug              /var/log/syslog.out     rotate size 100k files 4
#  *.crit               /var/log/syslog.out     rotate time 1d
#

*.info /var/adm/ras/syslog.caa rotate size 1m files 10
daemon.info	/var/log/vxfs.log rotate size 50k files 4
