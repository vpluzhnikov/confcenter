# slp.conf -- SLP configuration file
# General usage rules:
# All parameters for an entry must be contained on one line in the
# configuration file.
# Comments may be included in the file beginning with a pound sign ('#') in
# column 1.
# The format is:
# <keyword> = <value>
# or 
# <keyword> = <value1>,<value2>,..., <valueN>
# If there are more than 1 value to be configured, use ',' as separator.
#
# If there are multiple lines configured against the same <keyword>, the 1st valid
# configured line will be read, the rest will be ignored.

# net.slp.maxResults 
# A 32 bit integer giving the maximum number of results to accumulate and return for a 
# synchronous request before the timeout, Positive integers and -1 are legal values.  
# If -1, indicates that all results should be returned. 
# Default value is -1. 
# for example:
# net.slp.maxResults = 35
      
# net.slp.useScopes 
# A value-list of strings indicating the only scopes a UA or SA  is allowed to use when 
# making requests or registering, or the scopes a DA must support. 
# Default: scope "DEFAULT" is used if no other information is available. 
# for example:
# net.slp.useScopes = david,bob
      
# net.slp.DAAddresses 
# A value-list of IP addresses or DNS resolvable host names giving the SLPv2 DAs to use for 
# statically configured UAs and SAs. 
# Default is none. 
# for example:
# net.slp.DAAddresses = 9.3.149.20, blahblah.ibm.com
      
# net.slp.isBroadcastOnly 
# A boolean indicating if broadcast should be used instead of multicast. 
# Default is false. So the default is multicast. 
# for example:
# net.slp.isBroadcastOnly = false
      
# net.slp.multicastTTL 
# A positive integer less than or equal to 255, giving the multicast TTL. 
# Default is 255 (in seconds). 
# for example:
# net.slp.multicastTTL = 255
      
# net.slp.DAActiveDiscoveryInterval 
# A 16 bit positive integer giving the number of seconds between DA active discovery queries.  
# If this parameter is set to zero, active discovery is turned off. This property corresponds 
# to the protocol specification parameter CONFIG_DA_FIND. 
# Default is 900  (in seconds). 
# for example:
# net.slp.DAActiveDiscoveryInterval = 1200
      
# net.slp.multicastMaximumWait 
# A 32 bit integer giving the maximum amount of time to perform multicast, in milliseconds. 
# This property corresponds to the CONFIG_MC_MAX parameter in the protocol specification. 
# Default is 15000  (in ms) 
# for example:
# net.slp.multicastMaximumWait = 10000
      
# net.slp.multicastTimeouts 
# A value-list of 32 bit integers used as timeouts, in milliseconds, to implement the multicast 
# convergence algorithm.  Each value specifies the time to wait before sending the next request. 
# This property corresponds to the CONFIG_MC_RETRY parameter in the protocol specification. 
# Default is: 3000,3000,3000,3000,3000 (in ms) 
# There is no limitation on the maximum number entries to be specified. However the total sum 
# of the entries can't be bigger than CONFIG_MC_RETRY (15000 in ms). 
# for example:
# net.slp.multicastTimeouts = 2000, 3000, 4000
      
# net.slp.DADiscoveryTimeouts 
# A value-list of 32 bit integers used as timeouts, in milliseconds, to implement the multicast 
# convergence algorithm during active DA discovery.  Each value specifies the time to wait 
# before sending the next request,This property corresponds to the protocol specification 
# parameter CONFIG_RETRY. 
# Default is:  2000,2000,2000,2000,3000,4000 (in ms) 
# There is no limitation on the maximum number entries to be specified. However the total sum 
# of the entries can't be bigger than CONFIG_RETRY (15000 in ms). 
# for example:
# net.slp.DADiscoveryTimeouts = 2000, 3000, 4000
      
# net.slp.datagramTimeouts 
# A value-list of 32 bit integers used as timeouts, in milliseconds, to implement unicast 
# datagram transmission to DAs.  The nth value gives the time to block waiting for a reply on 
# the nth try to contact the DA. The sum of these values is the protocol specification 
# property CONFIG_RETRY_MAX. 
# Default is: 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 3000, 4000 (in ms) 
# There is no limitation on the maximum number entries to be specified. However the total sum 
# of the entries can't be bigger than CONFIG_RETRY_MAX (15000 in ms).
# for example:
# net.slp.datagramTimeouts = 2000, 3000, 4000

# net.slp.SAAttributes
# A comma-separated list of parenthesized attribute/value list pairs that the SA must advertise 
# in SAAdverts.  The property must be in the SLP attribute list wire format, including escapes 
# for reserved characters.
# for example:
# net.slp.SAAttributes = (user=zaphod,trillian,roger,marvin)

# net.slp.interfaces
# Value-list of strings giving the IP addresses of network interfaces on which the DA or SA 
# should listen on port 427 for multicast, unicast UDP, and TCP messages.  Default is empty,
# i.e.  use the default network interface.
# for example:
# net.slp.interfaces = 9.3.149.20,9.3.149.50
