#
#   This file contains directives that can be specified by the
#   server's administrator to configure the server and enforce
#   policies.
#
#   Do not put any long line without white space in this file.
#
#   A line starting with a '#' character is a comment and is ignored.
#   A '#' on a line which is not part of a quoted string indicates
#   that anything to the right of this character is a comment and should
#   be ignored.
#
#   A continuation character of '\' is supported.  It must be
#	the last non-whitespace character on the line prior to
#	any comments.
#
#   The directives are specified in the form of 
#   <keyword> <value1> ... <valueN>.
#
#   Here is a list of all the keywords whose value can be specified  
#   in this file:
#
#   Keyword	                Effect
#   -------------    ---------------------------------------------------
#

#	
#   The scope of a keyword is limited by a pair of curly brackets ({, })
#   within which the keyword is located.  If a keyword is located outside
#   of any pair of curly brackets, its scope is applicable to all the 
#   entities served by this process.
#
#   The presence and values of these parameters are picked up by the
#   server that is started or restarted.
#

#
#  Log files.  This set of parameters specifies the log files that will be
#  maintained by this server.  Each parameter is identified by a keyword
#  and followed by its value.
#
#  Keyword	Value	      	Definition
#  --------	------------  	------------------------------------------
#  numLogFiles	0 to n	      	number of log files.  If 0 is specified, 
#				no log file will be maintained and no log

#
#  Networks and subnets.  This set of parameters specifies the networks and 
#  the subnets within the networks, as well as other parameters associated 
#  with each network or subnet.
#
#  Here is a list of the parameters in this set and their definitions:
#
#  Keyword   Value		Definition
#  --------  ---------------	------------------------------------------
#
#  network   <Network address> [<Subnet Mask>|<range>]
#
#				network statement.  It specifies one 
#				network administered by this server. 
#
#				Network address is the address of this
#				network.  This address is specified in the
#				dotted notation (e.g., 9.0.0.0, 128.81.0.0,
#				or, 192.81.20.0).  Full four-byte value
#				should be specified (i.e., 9, 128.81, or
#				192.81.20 is not legal).
#
#			        Network address may optionally be followed 
#				by the subnet mask, a range, or nothing.
#
#				If a subnet mask is specified, one or more 
#				subnet statements should appear in the
#				succeeding lines within a pair of curly 
#				brackets.  The subnet mask may be specified
#				either in the dotted notation (e.g.,
#				255.255.255.128) or as a number indicating
#				the number of 1 bits in the mask (e.g., 25,
#				which is equivalent to 255.255.255.128).
#
#				If a range is specified, it determines,
#				within the network, the range of hosts that
#				are administered by this server, and it
#				implies that there is no subnetting.  A range 
#				is specified by the host addresses, in the
#				dotted notation, at the lower end and the
#				higher end of the range, respectively,
#				separated by a hyphen with no interleaving
#				space (e.g., 192.81.20.1-129.81.20.128).
#
#				If nothing is specified after Network
#				address, all hosts in that network are
#				administered by this server.
#
#				A network statement may be immediately followed
#				by a pair of curly brackets, in which parameters
#				(e.g., options) particular to this network can
#				be specified.
#
#  subnet    <Subnet address> [<range>]
#  subnet    default
#
#				subnet statement.  One or more subnet 
#				statements are enclosed by a pair of curly 
#				brackets that immediately follows a network
#				statement with subnet mask.  A subnet 
#				statement specifies one subnet within that
#				network.
#
#				Subnet address is the address of this subnet.
#				This address is specified in the dotted
#				notation (e.g., 9.17.32.0 or 128.81.22.0).
#				
#  				Subnet address may be followed by a range or
#				nothing.
#
#				If a range is specified, it determines,
#				within the subnet, the range of hosts that
#				are administered by this server.  A range 
#				is specified by the host addresses, in the
#				dotted notation, at the lower end and the
#				higher end of the range, respectively,
#				separated by a hyphen with no interleaving
#				space. A range must encompass all addresses
#				to be administered since multiple subnet
#				statements to define the same subnet are
#				not allowed.  Use the "client" statement to
#				exclude any addresses in the range which the
#				server should not administer.
#
#				If nothing is specified after Subnet address,
#				all hosts in that subnet are administered
#				by this server.
#
#			        The ranges in two servers administering the  
#				the same subnet can not overlap.  Otherwise,
#				two hosts may be assigned the same address.
#
#
#				A subnet statement may be immediately followed
#				by a pair of curly brackets, in which parameters
#				(e.g., options) particular to this subnet can
#				be specified.
#           
#               When the keyword subnet is followed by the word
#               default. It means this container will be used
#               to give the options to clients whose address doesnot
#               fall in any of the subnets specified in the
#               configuration file. The default subnet is used
#               only when response is being generated for INFORM
#               from the client.
#
#
#  class     <class_name>   [<range>]
#			       Definition of a class.  The class name is a
# 				simple ascii string.  A class's scope is
#				determine by the curly brackets in which it
#				is enclosed.  If it is outside all curly
#				brackets, then its scope is the entire file.
#
#				A class name may be followed by a range or
#				nothing.  If a range of Ip Addresses is
#				specified, then only addresses in that range
#				will be assigned to clients who request this
#				class.  Note that clients who request this
#				class, for which the subnet does not match
#				the range will not be processes.  Bad
#				addresses will not be given out by the server.
#				If an address range is not specified, then
#				addresses will be given to clients using
#				the usual rules of assignment.
#
#				The class statement may be immediately followed
#				by a pair of curly brackets, in which
#				the options particular to this class can be
#				specified.  A class may be defined within
#				the curly brackets of a subnet, but a subnet
#				may not be defined within the curly brackets
#				of a class.
#
#				Options set up in the network or subnet
#				containing a class definition will also
#				apply to the class.
#
#  client   <id_type>  <id_value>  <address>
#				Definition of client/address processing.
#
#				<id_type> is 0 for a string otherwise it
#				is one of the hardware types defined in
#				RFC 1340 (i.e. 6 for IEEE 802 networks.)
#
#				<id_value> is a character string for <id_type>=0.
#				Typically, this would be a domain name.
#				For a non-zero <id_type>, the <id_value> is a
#				hexadecimal string representing
#				the hardware address of the client.
#
#				Note, an <id_type> of 0 and an <id_value> of
#				'0' indicates that the <address> specified
#				should not be distributed by this server.
#
#				The <address> can be the string "none" to indicate 
#				that the client with <id_type> and <id_value> should
#				should not be serviced by this server.  
#				The <address> can be the string "any" to
#				indicate that the server should choose
#				an appropriate address for this client.
#				The <address> can be an internet address
#				in dotted notation (eg. 9.2.15.82).  This
#				will be the Ip address given to the
#				particular client specified by <id_type>
#				and <id_value>.  As mentioned above, an
#				<id_type> of 0 and an <id_value> of '0'
#				indicates that the <address> specified
#				should not be distributed by this server.
#
#	Note: If a client is configured in this way on the server,
#		then any class information requested by the client
#		will be ignored.  No class specific information
#		will be processed for these clients.
#
#	The client statement may be immediately followed
#	by a pair of curly brackets, in which the options
#	particular to this client can be specified.
#
#	A client statement with an address specified that is not
#	part of the address pool specified in a network/subnet
#	elsewhere in this file must contain the subnet mask option(1)
#	For all other clients, the server will compute the subnet mask
#	option to send the client based on the network/subnet definitions.
#
#	Note: All clients inherit all globally defined options.
#		A client defined in a network scope will inherit
#		options defined for that network.
#		A client defined in a subnet scope, will inherit
#		options defined for that subnet and emcompassing network.
#
#	A class definition inside a client scope is not allowed.
#
#	The client statement may be used to configure bootp clients.
#	To do this, specify all the bootp options using the option
#	syntax defined below.  In addition, specify an infinite
#	lease time in the client scope with "option 51 0xffffffff".
#	DHCP options will not be served to the bootp client.
#
#
#  Option.  This parameter specifies the value of an option defined in 
#  "DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions" (RFC 1533) and supported by
#  this server. 
#
#  An option is specified by the "option" keyword followed by the option code 
#  of this option and its data field, in a single line.  One or more of this 
#  parameter may be specified.
#
#  The scope within which an option applies is delimited by a pair of curly 
#  brackets ({, }) surrounding this parameter.
#
#  Two or more options with the same option code may be specified.  Their data
#  fields are concatenated in a single option in a packet generated by the server
#  if the options have the same scope or one's scope includes that of another.
#  
#  Some of the defined options do not need to be specified by this parameter.
#  These options are either mandated by the protocol or this implementation 
#  to be present in proper packets, or only generated by a client.  These 
#  options are (option code and name):
#
#  	0   	Pad Option			
#  	255	End Option 			
#  	1	Subnet Mask
#  	50	Request IP Address       
#  	51	IP Address Lease Time    
#  	52	Option Overload 		
#  	53	DHCP Message Type               
#  	54	Server Identifier               
#  	55	Parameter Request List          
#  	57	Maximum DHCP Message Size
#  	58	Renewal (T1) Time Value  
#  	59	Rebinding (T2) Time Value
#  	60	Class-identifier of client
#  	61	Client-identifier.
#
#   pxebootfile         pxebootfile  <System Arch> <Major Ver> <Minor Ver> <Bootfilename> <Type> <Layer>
#                       Specifies the bootfile to be given to a client.
#                       The config file parser generates an error if the number of parameters after
#                       the keyword is less than 4 and ignore if more than 4.  This keyword can 
#                       be used only in a container.
#
#
#   dhcp_proxy_ipaddr   dhcp_or_proxy_address < IP address >
#                       This gives the IP address of dhcp or pxed server to which the BINLD server 
#                       can send an Unicast packet of type REQUEST / INFORM to receive the Multicast 
#                       Address.  This  keyword is defined only when the dhcp or pxed are on a 
#                       different subnet than BINLD.
#

#                       vendor pxe
#                       vendor pxeserver
#                       Specifies a vendor container. Vendor containers are used to return option 43 
#                       to the client. The vendor id may be specified in a quoted string or a binary 
#                       string in the form 0xhexdigits or hex"digits". An optional range may be placed 
#                       after the vendor id. The range is specified as two dotted quads separated by a dash.
#                       After the optional range, an optional hexstring or ASCII string can be specified as
#                       the first part of the option 43. If options are in the container, they are appended
#                       to the option 43 data. After all options are processed an End Of Option List Option
#                       is appended to the data. To return options outside of an option 43, use a regular 
#                       expression client that matches all clients to specify normal options to return 
#                       based on the vendor ID.
#                       vendor pxe will create a vendor container for PXEClient's and vendor pxeserver
#                       create a vendor container for PXEServer.
#                  
#  The other options may be specified by this parameter.
#
#  When specifying an option, its data field takes one of the following
#  formats:
#
#	IP Address	    :	a single IP address.
#	IP Addresses	    :	One or more IP addresses separated by white 
#				 space(s).
#	IP Address Pair     :	two IP addresses separated by a single colon.
