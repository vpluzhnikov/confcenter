# This file contains the hostnames and their address for hosts in the
# network.  This file is used to resolve a hostname into an Internet
# address.  
#
# At minimum, this file must contain the name and address for each
# device defined for TCP in your /etc/net file.  It may also contain
# entries for well-known (reserved) names such as timeserver
# and printserver as well as any other host name and address.
#
# The format of this file is:
# Internet Address	Hostname	# Comments
# Internet Address can be either IPv4 or IPv6 address.
# Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tabs.  A '#'
# indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the
# line are not interpreted by routines which search this file.  Blank
# lines are allowed.
