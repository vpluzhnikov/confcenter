# General usage rules:
# All parameters for an entry must be contained on one line in the
# configuration file.
# A"-" (dash) is used to indicate the default value for a keyword.
# Sequence numbers are not allowed on the statements
# Comments may be included in the file beginning with a pound sign ('#') in
# column 1.
# The secName and password parameters are case-sensitive.
# As the clsnmp command supports both issuance of SNMP requests and receipt
# of SNMP traps, the entries in the clsnmp.conf file must be defined for both
# uses.
# Multiple entries for the same USM user are allowed within the file.  This
# may be useful to define different security levels for the same user.
# If multiple entries for the same USM user are defined, be aware that only
# the first one in the file can be used for receiving notifications.  If
# multiple entries for the same USM user are defined and the user will be
# used for receiving notifications, the definition with the highest (most
# stringent) securityLevel should be defined first.  Doing so will allow the
# user to be used for any level of security equal to or lower (less
# stringent) than the securityLevel defined.
