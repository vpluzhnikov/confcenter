*******************************************************************************
* VALID ATTRIBUTES FOR /etc/security/domobjs:
*
* For more information on the following attributes, please read the
* /etc/security/domobjs documentation
*
* domains	Defines the list of domains that are allowed access to the 
* 		object

* conflictsets	Defines the list of domains that are forbidden from accessing 
* 		the object
*
* objtype	Defines the type of the object. Valid values are
* 		device	- 	For devices like block, volume group, etc. The 
* 				full path to device should be provided as the 
* 				object name
* 		file	-	For regular files and directories. The full path 
* 				should be provided as the object name
* 		netint	- 	For network interfaces
* 		netport	-	For ports and port ranges. The port number or 
* 				range of ports should be prefixed with TCP_ or 
* 				UDP_. Ranges are to be specified in the format 
* 				X-Y, where X and Y are positive numbers and X 
* 				should be greater than Y. For e.g. TCP_120-200
*
* secflags	The security flags for the object. Valid values are FSF_DOM_ALL 
* 		and FSF_DOM_ANY. It modifies the access behaviour only for the 
* 		domains attribute. If the value is FSF_DOM_ANY any user/process 
* 		having any of the domains listed in the domains attribute can 
* 		access the object. The FSF_DOM_ALL mandates that the 
* 		user/process accessing the object must have all the domains as 
* 		listed in the domains attribute.  If not provided the default of 
* 		FSF_DOM_ALL is assumed
* 
*

* EXAMPLES:
*
* /dev/hd1:
*	domains = HR,FINANCE
*	conflictsets = ADMIN
* 	objtype = device 
*	secflags = FSF_DOM_ANY
*
* en0:
*	domains =  INTRANET,DATABASE
*	conflictsets = INTERNET
* 	objtype = netint 
*	secflags = FSF_DOM_ALL
*
* TCP_120-200:
*	domains = APPS
* 	objtype = netport
